# pomodoro-timer
### The executable for this program can be found under Releases or at https://github.com/AlessiaRuggiero/pomodoro-timer/releases/tag/v0.1 .
## The Concept
### The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method aimed towards improving concentration and work productivity. The technique leads the participant through three session-types: a work session, a short break session, and a relax session; it iterates through a number of work - break session cycles before rewarding the participant with a relax session. 
### This program defaults these values to 25, 5, and 15 minutes respectively, but they are modifiable within a range-limit. The user is intially presented with a main initialization frame where they are able to perform these value changes via spin-box. After initializing the timer, the user is directed to the timer itself, on which they are able to perform three on-click operations: start, pause, and reset. As the the timer runs the user is led through 3 iterations of work - break session cycles followed by a relax session. The current session information and overall progress is relayed to the user on-screen throughout the duration of the program.
## Features 
### GUI - A GUI is constructed using Python's Tkinter library.
